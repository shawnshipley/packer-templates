# packer-templates

- Attribution: These scripts all originated from https://github.com/StefanScherer and modified for my needs.
- Save ISO files to the ISO folder.
- After packer image has been created, copy to permanent location. Then import into VMWare Workstation and take a snapshot. Then convert the VM to a template. Now you can create linked clones from the packer template.
